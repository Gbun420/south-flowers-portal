## Frontend Development

I can help you with tasks related to the Next.js application source code.

- **Modify existing components:** "Add a loading state to the `StrainCard.tsx` component."

- **Modify layouts:** "Add a footer to the main layout in `src/app/layout.tsx`."

### State Management and Data Fetching
