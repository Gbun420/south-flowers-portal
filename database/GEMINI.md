# Gemini Interaction Guide for `database`

This guide is specific to the `database` directory.

## Database Schema
I can help you understand and modify the database schema defined in `schema.sql`.

- "What tables are defined in the schema?"
- "Add a `last_login` timestamp column to the `users` table in `schema.sql`."
- "Explain the policies defined in `fix-policies.sql`."

## SQL Queries
I can help you write and debug SQL queries.

- "Write a SQL query to get all orders from the last 24 hours."
- "This query is slow, can you help me optimize it?" (You'll need to provide the query).

## Database Seeding/Setup
I can help with the SQL scripts for setting up the database.
- "Explain what `create-admin.sql` does."
