# Gemini Interaction Guide for south-flowers-portal

Hello! I'm Gemini, your AI assistant for this project. Here's how you can interact with me effectively.

## Project Context

I have access to the file structure and content of the `south-flowers-portal` project. I'm aware that this is a Next.js application using TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Supabase for the backend.

## How I Can Help

You can ask me to perform various tasks, including:

### Code Understanding and Explanation
- "Explain the purpose of the `middleware.ts` file."
- "What does the `src/lib/supabase/server.ts` file do?"
- "Summarize the `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` component."

### Code Generation and Modification
- "Create a new page for user profiles under `/dashboard/profile`."
- "Add a new function to `src/app/dashboard/actions.ts` to update user data."
- "Refactor the `Logo.tsx` component to use SVG."

### Database-related Tasks
- "What are the columns in the `users` table based on `database/schema.sql`?"
- "Generate a SQL query to select all active users."

### Testing
- "Write a test for the new function you created."
- "How do I run the tests for this project?" (I'll look at `package.json` and other config files).

### General Project Questions
- "How is this project deployed?" (I'll check `DEPLOYMENT.md` and `netlify.toml`).
- "What are the steps to set up the development environment?" (I'll refer to `ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md` and `SETUP.md`).

## Best Practices for Interacting with Me

- **Be specific:** The more specific your request, the better I can assist you. For example, instead of "fix the bug," say "The login page crashes when the user enters a wrong password. Please fix it."
- **Provide context:** If you're asking about a specific piece of code, provide the file path.
- **Iterate:** We can work together. If my first attempt isn't perfect, give me feedback and we can refine it.

I'm here to help you build and maintain the `south-flowers-portal` project. Let's get started!
